# Connect 4 Game

An implementation of Connect 4 game in Reactjs.

I made this game as an exploratory project to learn more on the following: 

- Exploring state management best practices with [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).
- Implementing Drag and Drop with  [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd).
- Exploring how to use [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/) api with [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect).

## Running Locally

```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:AlahmadiQ8/connect-4.git
  $ cd connect-4 
  $ yarn install 
  $ yarn start
```
